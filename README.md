1. Loss function:
Classificaiton problem:
Cross entropy
Hinge loss

Entropy: 
Hinge loss is faster to train in gradient descent than cross entropy - real time desicion making

If accuracy is more important, use cross entropy

Regression:
MSE,
MAE (L1 loss), is more robust to outliers than MSE
Huber loss, even more robust to outliers
